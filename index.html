<h1>Open Source Tools and Technology Sponsored by Tresys</h1>
<p>This Open Source Software site provides a home for
collaborative software development of tools and technology
sponsored by Tresys Technology. Many of the projects originated in 
the R&amp;D division at Tresys.  Other projects, such as the 
<a href="http://oss.tresys.com/projects/selinux" alt="Security Enhanced Linux">Security Enhanced Linux Project</a>, 
started elsewhere but are now hosted here.</p>
<p>We invite contributors to be a part of the effort. From the
project list below, choose a project and browse the current
activity.</p>

<h2>Projects hosted on other sites</h2>
<p>Tresys contributes to numerous open source projects.  Some of these projects started on oss.tresys.com but have moved elsewhere.  These moves were the result of community feedback.  Folks wanted to see the projects merged into Red Hat's Fedora distribution which we see as a vote of confidence in the software we developed and a chance to ensure broader adoption of the technologies.  Please check out our projects at their new online homes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux" title="SELinux Userspace">SELinux Userspace</a> - The userspace components of Security-Enhanced Linux are now hosted on <a href="http://selinuxproject.org" title="SELinux Userspace">selinuxproject.org</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/secstate/" title="SecState">SecState</a> - A tool for managing and interpreting SCAP content, XCCDF and OVAL, now hosted on <a href="http://fedorahosted.org" title="Fedora Hosted">Fedora Hosted</a>.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Other projects we help with in the security community</h2>
<p>While we maintain several open source projects we are also contributors to several other projects maintained by other members of the security community.</a>   
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://selinuxproject.org/" title="The SELinux Project">SELinux Project</a> - Since 2003 Tresys has been actively contributing to the large the Security-Enhanced Linux project.  It is one of our proudest endeavors wherein we participated in maturing a key technology in the Linux space enabling numerous environments to leverage the benefits of this technolgy without the pain typically associated with security.</li>
	</ul>
<!--
<h2>Retired projects</h2>
<p>As an organization focused on the cutting edge we occasionally shelve projects.  Sometimes things just don't pan out as we expected.  We learn from each and every experience and feel these projects provide value, if only through lessons-learned.  They are no longer maintained but since we learned from our experiences we want to share the knowledge with the community so we list them below.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://oss.tresys.com/projects/policy-server" title="The SELinux Policy Server">SELinux Policy Server</a> - This was an effort to create SELinux policy access controls via a meta policy for SELinux policy and a system for managing and deploying policy in a networked environment.</li>
